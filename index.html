          <p>
            Virtual Reality is a technology that creates a simulated world using
            pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays. Users wear a headset that
            blocks out the real world and immerses them in the virtual
            environment. They can interact with the virtual world using
            controllers or body movements, everything they see and hear feeling
            real. All that can be done without leaving your chair with this
            technology. Other distinct types of VR-style technology include

          <p>
            VR holds immense potential in education across various subjects. It
            offers immersive experiences, enabling students to conduct safe
            experiments and visit virtual museums or locations. In physics,
            students can simulate gravity effects or explore celestial bodies
            like the Moon. Engineering students benefit from designing
            prototypes and visualizing complex scenarios like bridge stress.
            Primary school students engage with augmented reality (AR) tools to
            explore STEM concepts or historical settings. VR facilitates
            collaborative learning and provides historical or futuristic
            experiences, enhancing educational engagement and understanding.

          <p>
            Traditional gaming has its charm, but VR is quickly becoming the new
            standard due to its unparalleled immersion. Instead of just
            controlling a character on a screen, you're thrust into the heart of
            the action, exploring captivating worlds and living out thrilling
            adventures like never before. Developers are breaking free from
            traditional constraints, crafting richer narratives and pushing
            technological boundaries. With fewer VR titles available, studios
            have the chance to innovate, offering fresh experiences. Beyond
            gaming, VR has real-life benefits. Studies show users feel more
            confident and outgoing after diving into virtual worlds. And with a
            growing selection of VR fitness games like Supernatural, staying
            active has never been more fun. Box to your favorite tunes or find
            your zen through virtual yoga - all from the comfort of home.
